## How to share anthems
Anthems generated with this mod can be shared using the png of the creation. All users who have this mod installed will be able to download your anthems. Those without the mod will be able to hear only the first 16 notes and 25 tones, and the additional elements will be replaced by default ones.

**Certain rules must be followed for hymns to be shared:**
> - Must necessarily have at least one ambient (the pink ones)
> - The anthem must have at least 1 note
> - You can mute any category you don't want to be heard (rhythm, instrument, ambient)
